This is a short guide on to upgrade your system to Debian 13 which is testing and packages are a lot more up to date for example Hyprland needs Debian 13. You can do it from pretty much any version to start run this command.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list 
```

Replace where it says your Debian version code name that you have installed to trixie e.g

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware
```

To

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ trixie-security main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ trixie-security main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main non-free-firmware
```

Enter these commands to upgrade

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

Then reboot your system and run neofetch to double check and you should have Debian 13.
