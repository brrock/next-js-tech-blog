# Introduction 
This is my simple guide on how to install Hyprland, an Wayland compositer and window manager which I daily drive, on Debain Linux and Ubuntu.

# Install 
Either follow the steps below or read the official hyprland [docs](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/) which I have contributed to my self and the steps are the same.
On Debain make sure you have the trixie repos on (If you don't know how [Click here](Https://techblog.benjyross.xyz/blog/debian-trixie-upgrade-guide)) and run this in terminal. Note: You need a login manager (lightdm doesn't work) and it will install kitty a terminal emulator which hyprland uses.
```bash
# debian
sudo apt install hyprland kitty -y
# Ubuntu - this enables universe repos btw
sudo add-apt-repository universe && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y hyprland
```
# To summarise 
This is a simple, easy way to install hyprland on debain. Hyprland looks dull without dotfiles - [here are mine](Https://GitHub.com/brrock/dotfiles).
